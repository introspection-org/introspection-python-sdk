[Introspection](https://introspection.dev) is the managed cloud for vertical
agents, powered by Pi. Define an agent as a recipe, deploy it to a
commit-pinned runtime, and improve it in production with conversations,
patterns, judges, and experiments.

This is the Python execution SDK. Use it to open a runner against a configured
runtime or experiment, start and stream tasks, and work with files,
conversations, events, metrics, and shares. It provides both an async-first client and a matching
synchronous client. See the [SDK overview](https://docs.introspection.dev/sdk)
and [Python guide](https://docs.introspection.dev/sdk/python) for the product
workflow.

## Install

```shell
uv add introspection-sdk
# or
pip install introspection-sdk
```

The default install is everything you need for the Introspection API
(runtimes, tasks, files, conversations) — no OpenTelemetry pulled in. To also
emit analytics events and export traces, add the `[otel]` extra; see
[**OpenTelemetry**](#opentelemetry-analytics--tracing) below.

## Introspection API (runtimes, tasks, files)

The main Introspection API. Open a `Runner` against a runtime, spawn tasks, and
stream their output; manage `files` and read `conversations` on the same Runner.
`AsyncIntrospectionClient` is the recommended entry point — everything that
touches the network is awaitable, and run output streams with `async for`:

```python
import asyncio

from introspection_sdk import AsyncIntrospectionClient


async def main() -> None:
    async with AsyncIntrospectionClient() as client:  # token from INTROSPECTION_TOKEN
        runner = await client.runtime("customer-agent").run(
            agent_name="agent",
            scope="tasks:read tasks:write files:read files:write events:read metrics:read",
        )

        async with runner:
            run = await runner.tasks.start(prompt="Say hello in one sentence.")

            async for event in run.stream():
                print(event.model_dump_json(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True))


asyncio.run(main())
```

### Resilient streaming

`run.stream()` **resumes transparently** across a mid-turn disconnect — gateway
idle-timeout, load-balancer recycle, network blip. On a drop it re-attaches with
the SSE-standard `Last-Event-ID` so the server replays the frames you missed,
and the iterator yields one gap-free `AGUIEvent` sequence. There is no
consumer-visible change: the `async for` above just keeps working, completing
when the turn finishes and raising only if recovery is exhausted. Keyword args
tune the recovery bounds:

```python
async for event in run.stream(max_reconnects=5, timeout=300.0):
    ...
```

Readiness folds in the same way: while a run is not yet attachable the server
answers with `429` + `Retry-After`, which the stream honours as a backoff floor
and retries — never surfaced to the caller.

### Retries (429 / 502 / 503 / 504)

The unary calls — `tasks.get` (status polling), lists, create, cancel, delete,
file metadata/content — **auto-retry on `429 Too Many Requests`** for every
method, and on `502`/`503`/`504` for idempotent `GET` calls only. A `429` means
the request was rejected before it was processed, so re-sending is safe even
for writes; a `502`/`503`/`504` may have been processed upstream, so only reads
are retried. When the server sends `Retry-After` it is honoured as the floor of
a capped-exponential backoff, but it is not required — the retry decision is
status-based. Retries are bounded (`max_retries`, default 2; `0` disables) and
once the budget is spent the error surfaces as usual (a `429` as a
`RateLimitError` with `retry_after`, a `503`/`504` as a
`SandboxUnavailableError`) so you can back off further. The same applies to the
async client. Streaming has its own resume budget (above); multipart uploads
are not auto-retried.

A Runner exposes three DP-bound namespaces side by side: `runner.tasks`,
`runner.files`, and the read-only `runner.conversations`. The conversations
namespace lists conversation summaries (`runner.conversations.list()`), loads
the latest LLM turn of a conversation as a Responses-API-style view
(`await runner.conversations.retrieve(conversation_id)`), and walks a
conversation's per-turn items (`runner.conversations.items.list(...)`).

Every `list()` returns an `AsyncPager`: `async for` it to stream every item
across pages (fetched lazily), or `await` it for the first page with its
envelope metadata (counts, cursors):

```python
# Stream every summary across all pages.
async for summary in runner.conversations.list(limit=20):
    response = await runner.conversations.retrieve(
        summary.conversation_id or summary.trace_id
    )
    if response is not None:
        print(response.model, len(response.input_messages))

# Or just the first page, with totals.
first = await runner.files.list(include_total=True)
print(first.total_count, len(first.records))
```

See [`examples/api/async_runtimes.py`](examples/introspection_examples/api/async_runtimes.py)
for an end-to-end walkthrough.

### Service-account (machine) auth

A long-lived `INTROSPECTION_TOKEN` is the simplest credential. For headless /
CI callers that should not ship a static key, authenticate as a confidential
**service-account** Application instead — `from_service_account` mints a
short-lived, project-scoped token via the OAuth `client_credentials` grant and
wires it in, so the runtime flow is unchanged:

```python
from introspection_sdk import IntrospectionClient

client = IntrospectionClient.from_service_account(
    client_id="intro_app_…",      # confidential Application
    client_secret="intro_sk_…",   # minted once, kept server-side
    project="my-project",         # slug or UUID; the token is project-scoped
)
runner = client.runtime("customer-agent").run()
```

The token is not auto-refreshed — re-mint once it expires
(`AsyncIntrospectionClient.from_service_account` is the awaitable twin).

When you're a **server broker** handing credentials to a browser client, mint
the token directly to also read `dp_url` (the Data Plane endpoint the Control
Plane resolved for the project). Runtime configuration and selection remain in
the operator-facing CLI/frontend rather than this application SDK:

```python
from introspection_sdk import service_account_token

token = service_account_token(
    client_id="intro_app_…",
    client_secret="intro_sk_…",
    project="my-project",
)
# -> hand { token.access_token, token.dp_url } to the browser
```

`token_exchange` (RFC 8693 partner-IdP federation) and
`authorization_code_token` (PKCE hosted-login callback) are the matching
server-side helpers for end-user auth — each returns the same `OAuthToken`
shape, carrying `dp_url`. See
[`examples/api/service_account.py`](examples/introspection_examples/api/service_account.py).

### Sync client

Not on `asyncio`? `IntrospectionClient` is the synchronous twin with an
identical surface — drop the `await`s, use `for` instead of `async for`, and
`with` instead of `async with` ([`examples/api/runtimes.py`](examples/introspection_examples/api/runtimes.py)):

```python
from introspection_sdk import IntrospectionClient

client = IntrospectionClient()  # token from INTROSPECTION_TOKEN
runner = client.runtime("customer-agent").run()

run = runner.tasks.start(prompt="Say hello in one sentence.")
for event in run.stream():
    print(event.model_dump_json(by_alias=True, exclude_none=True))

runner.close()
client.shutdown()
```

## OpenTelemetry (analytics & tracing)

Two optional OTel-based surfaces live behind the `[otel]` extra, independent of
the Introspection API above:

```shell
pip install 'introspection-sdk[otel]'
```

- **Analytics events** — `track` / `feedback` / `identify` via `IntrospectionLogs`.
- **Traces** — export OpenTelemetry spans with `IntrospectionSpanProcessor`.

Both are documented in [**`docs/otel.md`**](docs/otel.md).

Support for other LLM frameworks is experimental.

## Environment variables

```shell
# Introspection API (IntrospectionClient / AsyncIntrospectionClient)
export INTROSPECTION_TOKEN="intro_xxx"
export INTROSPECTION_BASE_API_URL="https://api.introspection.dev"   # optional
# The project is scoped by the API key. Pass project per call only to override
# it with a slug or UUID.

# OTel (IntrospectionLogs + span processors + instrumentors) — see docs/otel.md
export INTROSPECTION_BASE_OTEL_URL="https://otel.introspection.dev" # optional
export INTROSPECTION_SERVICE_NAME="my-service"                      # optional
```
